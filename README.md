# Medical-Diagnosis-App
-->This app will interactively ask the user about the symptoms, which he is facing and then it will predict the disease of the user using the concept of decision            trees(DATA ANALYSIS). Also, this code is run on a dataset(attached), so, the user should provide symptoms which are present in the dataset.

-->The python code of this application are available in 2 formats:
  1. the main code for the pywebio application is included in the file main.py(attached).
  2. the python code with all the necessary comments and explainations of the code, refer to this GOOGLE COLAB NOTEBOOK link :
    https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1dGWFOPbg9n4JqD4Wij2KobRHw0X9LEmM?usp=sharing#scrollTo=_FWZkHbNonhs

-->The datasets used for the disease prediction were taken from the KAGGLE website(attached):
  1. 

PS: This is my original code of desicion trees and I have not used any library for this.
